CallLogFixer

This software is released under the BSD license. Use at your own risk.

This simple tool is designed to rectify a bug that occurs when some apps (I 
encountered this with an app called Amivox) add records to the call log that
have a type that's not recognized by the Android stock Phone app.

To trigger this bug open this app, hit the "Create a spurious callog record" 
button and go to the Phone app, it should crash. To make the phone app stop 
crashing open the app again and hit the "Delete all spurious callog records" 
button.
